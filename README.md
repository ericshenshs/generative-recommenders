# Why Clone?

The cloned repository is for understanding the original codebase: We use cursor to add comments to the codebase, keeping the original codebase unchanged.

## Code Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `configs/`: Configuration files for different datasets and model variants
  - `ml-1m/`: Configurations for MovieLens-1M experiments
  - `ml-20m/`: Configurations for MovieLens-20M experiments
  - `ml-3b/`: Configurations for MovieLens-3B experiments
  - `amzn-books/`: Configurations for Amazon Books experiments

- `generative_recommenders/`: Core model implementation

- `trainer/`: Training loop and data loading utilities
  - [x] `data_loader.py`: Data loading and preprocessing
  - `trainer.py`: Main training loop logic

# Generative Recommenders

Repository hosting code for ``Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations`` (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152, ICML'24) and related code, where we demonstrate that the ubiquitously used classical deep learning recommendation paradigm (DLRMs) can be reformulated as a generative modeling problem (Generative Recommenders or GRs) to overcome known compute scaling bottlenecks, propose efficient algorithms such as HSTU and M-FALCON to accelerate training and inference for large-scale sequential models by 10x-1000x, and demonstrate scaling law for the first-time in deployed, billion-user scale recommendation systems.

Currently only code for reproducing public experiments listed in the paper (Section 4.1.1) and Triton kernels for efficiency experiments (Section 4.2) are included. We plan to add integration code needed for throughput/performance benchmarks at a later point in time.

## Getting started

### Public experiments

To reproduce the public experiments (traditional sequential recommender setting, Section 4.1.1) on MovieLens and Amazon Reviews in the paper, please follow these steps:

#### Install dependencies.

(Optional) Use conda to install dependencies.

```bash
conda create --name generative-recommenders python=3.10 pytorch
conda activate generative-recommenders
```

Install PyTorch based on official instructions. Then,

```bash
pip3 install gin-config absl-py scikit-learn scipy matplotlib numpy apex hypothesis pandas fbgemm_gpu iopath tensorboard
```

#### Download and preprocess data.

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/ && python3 preprocess_public_data.py
```

#### Run model training.

A GPU with 24GB or more HBM should work for most datasets.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 main.py --gin_config_file=configs/ml-1m/hstu-sampled-softmax-n128-large-final.gin --master_port=12345
```

Other configurations are included in configs/ml-1m, configs/ml-20m, and configs/amzn-books to make reproducing these experiments easier.

#### Verify results.

By default we write experimental logs to exps/. We can launch tensorboard with something like the following:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-1m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-20m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/amzn-books-l50/ --port 24001 --bind_all
```

With the provided configuration (.gin) files, you should be able to reproduce the following results (verified as of 04/15/2024):

for all three tables above, the ``SASRec`` rows are based on [Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09781) but with the original binary cross entropy loss
replaced with sampled softmax losses proposed in [Revisiting Neural Retrieval on Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04039). These rows are reproducible with ``configs/*/sasrec-*-final.gin``.
The ``BERT4Rec`` and ``GRU4Rec`` rows are based on results reported by [Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07602) -
note that the comparison slightly favors these two, due to them using full negatives whereas the other rows used 128/512 sampled negatives. The ``HSTU`` and ``HSTU-large`` rows are based on [Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152); in particular, HSTU rows utilize identical configurations as SASRec. ``HSTU`` and ``HSTU-large`` results can be reproduced with ``configs/*/hstu-*-final.gin``.


#### Use synthetic dataset MovieLens-3B
We support generating synthetic dataset with fractal expansion introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08910. This allows us to expand the current 20 million real-world ratings from ML-20M to 3 billion.

To download the pre-generated synthetic dataset:

```bash
pip3 install gdown
mkdir -p tmp/ && cd tmp/
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-jZ6k0el7e7PyFnwqMLfqUTRh_Qdumt-
unzip ml-3b.zip && rm ml-3b.zip
```

To generate the synthetic dataset on your own:

```bash
python run_fractal_expansion.py --input-csv-file tmp/ml-20m/ratings.csv --write-dataset True --output-prefix tmp/ml-3b/
```

### Efficiency experiments

``ops/triton`` currently contains triton kernels needed for efficiency experiments (forward pass). More code (incl integration glue code) to be added at a later point in time. If it's urgent, please feel free to open PRs.
